Say you're working on a client job for a company in Norway and they have... creative ideas when it comes to paying invoices. What do you do with the work that you completed?

I rather liked this project and made some cool stuff happen, so instead of letting it vanish, I figured I'd instead open the source for anybody who might be interested. That way, it would at least show up in my commit history.

Furthermore, seeing that the company still has job listings published (actually put up two new ones while arguing, for months, that they could in no way pay me), this might also serve as valuable information for people who waste time actually entertaining the thought of applying.

Some of the neat stuff:

- Single-page Angular.js app
- Uses snap.svg and has some nifty tweening
- loads some of the content dynamically from a /wordpress install

Of course, all the vaguely copyrightable stuff was left out.
